G-One is an AI personal voice assistant service built using PyCharm. It can understand human speech and perform basic task designed by the client.

When the user specifies the appropriate trigger words, the G-One activates and executes the user commands.

2. Tell the time:
	> Hey G-One, what is the time?
		
3. Fetch top headlines from Times of India:
	> Hey G-One, what's the latest news?
		
4. Captures a photo:
	> Hey G-One, take a photo
		
5. Searches data from web:
	> Hey G-One, search butterfly images from web
		
6. Ask geographical and computational questions:
	> Hey G-One, what is the capital of California?
	
	> Hey G-One what is sin 90?
		
7. Predict weather of different cities:
	> Hey G-One, what is the weather like right now in Kerala?
		
8. Extract necessary information from Wikipedia:
	> Hey G-One, who is Bill Gates according to Wikipedia?
	
9. Ask G-One about what task it can perform and who created it:
	> Hey G-One, who created you?
	
	> Hey G-One, what can you do?
		
10. Turn off your PC when required;
   	> Hey G-One, please turn off my PC


### Libraries required to be installed using the pip command:
```
pip install json
pip install requests
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install wikipedia
pip install ecapture
pip install wolframalpha
```

G-One uses third party APIs to predict weather in different cities and to ask computational and geographical questions. 
Free API keys can be generated by creating an account in the following applications.  
	
* OpenWeatherMap -- for weather capabilities
	
* WolframAlpha -- to answer computational questions
